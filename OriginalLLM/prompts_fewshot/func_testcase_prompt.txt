**Role**: As a tester, your task is to generate *three* test cases based on the following code requirements. The test cases should cover the following aspects:

1. **Normal Case**: Verify that adding two normal integers results in the correct sum.
2. **Boundary Conditions**: Test with the minimum and maximum integer values to check for correct handling.

**Instructions**:
- Implement a comprehensive set of functional test inputs based on the given requirements for the function.
- The format should only be a JSON string. For example:{"input": 1.0, "expected_output": [1.0]}.
- Output should in triple backticks format(i.e., in ```json ```)

# For example:

## Prompt 1:
```python
def add_two_numbers(a, b):
    """
    Calculate and return the sum of two numbers.
    """
```

## Completion 1:
```json
{"input": [1, 1], "expected_output": 2}
{"input": [-1, 1], "expected_output": 0}
{"input": [9999, 1], "expected_output": 10000}
```
